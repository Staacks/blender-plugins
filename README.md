# blender-plugins
Some plugins I created for Blender.

More will be added whenever I have an interesting idea and the time and skill to implement it. Do not expect those plugins to be polished and well-maintained - they are just for fun and often for a specific one-time purpose. Still, feel free to leave issues if you encounter problems or (even better) pull-requests fixing them.

## growth-image

This plugin takes an image and calculates data to describe a growth animation for the structure shown in the original image. The result is stored in a new "growth image" providing timestamps for each pixel as non-color data.

To install it, you only need to download the growth-image.py file and install it with the install-button in Blender's add-on menu.

See https://there.oughta.be/a/blender-plugin-to-animate-growth for examples and details.
